![Preview](https://github.com/Azizkhasyi11/my-website/assets/74176356/efa53f99-27d6-46eb-ad0d-f6b2c6c1c395)

## Introduction

Finally, after some time I can build my own portofolio website again. And manage to build it using React + Vite, for my experience too.

## What I use

- Vite - As a build tool
- JavaScript - As a programming language
- React - As a library for building UI components
- Tailwind - As a utility-first CSS framework
- Vercel - As a deployment platform for this website
